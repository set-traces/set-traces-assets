This repo is used to organize and create assets for set traces. 
Help us create a logo!! Our current logo was made by Eirik after several bottles of Solo. Can you make something fantastic (I must admit it can be hard to beat Eirik's logo as it's absolutely someting for itself)

We would love to see your suggestions! Make a PR and you will hear from us! (At least our bots xoxo)
